in my college we have lectures about Numerical , i don&#8217;t know why i hate it but i think the reason why is the way of teaching .  
After a long term (it differs from long term scheduler ðŸ˜› ) we have a practical exam,thought this whole term i didn&#8217;t even setup the matlab to just check some codes ðŸ˜€  
one day before the exam i started to setup this f&#8230;.n program to try some code,but when i have explored the whole lectures and tutorials i thought i have to uninstall Matlab and just start to MEMORIZE all codes to pass the exam ðŸ˜€

after a hard day of practical exam i have solved all the problems but im not satisfied to do that, also i still HATE MARLAB
