Hello guys,  
while working on a project i needed to add a text input which takes some action when the user press on the &#8220;enter key&#8221;, you know it&#8217;s something like facebook comment text input ðŸ˜‰

as you may know there is no &#8220;onenterkey&#8221; or &#8220;onsubmit&#8221; for the text input. I stayed 15 min. trying to get the job done but in vain. That got me mad that i was talking to the text input &#8220;hey you mr. input how the hell you get that event fired ?!!!!!!&#8221;. finally i got a trick.

Here&#8217;s a little trick that may help.

you can use the &#8220;onkeydown&#8221; event and then check the pressed key if the key code is 13 &#8220;actually is the enter key code&#8221;. you can get the key code with that command &#8220;event.keyCode&#8221; 

As you can see it seen a little snippet but it got me out of that problem ðŸ˜€

Here&#8217;s a snippet that can demonstrate what i&#8217;m talking about

```js 
<input type="text" onkeydown="if (event.keyCode == 13) doSomeThing(paam1 , param2.....);" >
``` 

Hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed  
Thanks ðŸ™‚
