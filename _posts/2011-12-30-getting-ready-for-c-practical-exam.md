3 days before my C# practical exam so i must get ready for that great event ðŸ˜€ , also getting started to join the club ðŸ˜€

hmmmmmmmm, to study Dr.Yusef&#8217;s slides or to get some experience from some websites i think it&#8217;s big problem.

when i have some rest to think about the matter i just take a look about some programmers CV comparing them with my little CV, then i may leave these f&#8230;.n slides so go geek with some PHP codes ,yeah im totally in love with it (but also there&#8217;s some one who i can care more Â and more ðŸ˜‰ )

so i decided to study Dr.Yusef&#8217;s slides and i have to revise 28+154+181+137 slides ðŸ˜€ , but because the power of someone support i can get the job done&#8230;..
