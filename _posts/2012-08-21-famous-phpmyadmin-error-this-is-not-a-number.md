hey guys hope you have a good day,

Today a was developing a web app. which a mysql database. I used the famous tool phpmyadmin for that task.

while creating a table in my database i have got an error &#8220;this is not a number&#8221;. I have search on the web for it and a few people had the right solution.

The solution is to set the length field for nvarchar type and every thing will getting well ðŸ˜‰

so don&#8217;t forget to set the length field to get away from that fool error ðŸ˜€
